# Server-side rendered App with Next.js, Apollo and GraphCMS

ðŸš€ **[Live Demo](https://vinylbase.now.sh)**

This example shows how to build a small music blog with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), [Apollo](http://www.apollodata.com/) and [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com).

To connect your app you have to setup a new GraphCMS project and create the required content models as described [here](https://graphcms.com/docs/examples/Server-side_rendered_app_with_nextjs_and_apollo/).

To get this information, log into GraphCMS and go to your project settings.
